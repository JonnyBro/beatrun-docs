## Built-in Gamemodes

There are 3 gamemodes in Beatrun:

1. Data Theft
<Callout title="What's the catch?">
	You need to kill other players and collect Data Cubes from them. After collecting any amount you should deposit them at a random Data Bank.
</Callout>
2. Infection
3. Deathmatch (added by Jonny_Bro)

## Third Person Animations

I have no intentions to add them.

## Maps

Beatrun maps start with `br_`. Any map would work but those with `br_` tag are designed to be used with this gamemode.

## Flashlight Shadows Fix

This command fixes the bug when you can see your own shadow from your flashlight.

<Callout type="warn">This bug is currently unfixable because of the way your body is handled.</Callout>

```bash title="Console command"
r_flashlightdepthtexture 0
```
