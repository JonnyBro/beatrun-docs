First of all, there is some videos on YouTube explaining how to play Beatrun.

## Built-in Gamemodes

There are 3 gamemodes in Beatrun:

1. Data Theft - You need to kill other players and collect Data Cubes from them. After collecting any amount you should deposit them at a random Data Bank.
2. Infection - You need to touch other players and infect them, making them your team member.
3. Deathmatch (added by Jonny_Bro) - Just a DM gamemode, nothing special.

## Third Person Animations

I have no intentions to add them.

## Maps

Beatrun maps start with `br_`. Any map would work but those with `br_` tag are designed to be used with this gamemode.

## Flashlight Shadows Fix

This command fixes the bug when you can see your own shadow from your flashlight.
